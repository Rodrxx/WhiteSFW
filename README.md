# WhiteSFW
White version and improved battery state animations, improved heart rate and alarm shortcut visuals for easier reading on smaller displays, removed small shortcuts

List of changes from the original:

-Made everything white colored (like the in-game hud)

-24H mode only compatible (Removed AM and PM to place a new HRS text)

-Removed very small shortcuts to Phone and Messages.

-Improved reading on HR shortcut and made Alarm shortcut bigger, also repositioned them to match the status effect debuffs the game has

-Improved charging animations (Blinks red when <15%, blinks yellow when charging, and stays in blue when battery reached 100%, while descharges it gets from green to red in gradient.

-Everything is just a recolor from the original, granted to personal test.

-WFS only (no apk since i have no idea how to get the apk from WFS), so you need to have it in order to apply it.
